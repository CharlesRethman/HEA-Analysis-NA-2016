# HEA Analysis Nambia 2016

Repo: HEA-Analysis-NA-2016, folder is `~/Documents/hea_analysis/namibia/2016.05` on my disk.

Collection of folders:
* `./graphics`: set of maps and images feeding into and resulting from the analysis;
* `./livestock`: herd dynamics spreadsheet to determine composition of herds;
* `./maps`: QGIS map files for analysis of drought extent, affected populations, livelihood zones;
* `./met_images`: NDVI and other images on drought spatial distribution, as well as set of shape files for trimming all the junk off the edges of the NDVI image;
* `./spreadsheets`: Baseline Storage Spreadsheets (BSSs) and Outcome Analysis Spreadsheets (OASs) used in the 2016 Outcome Forecast Analysis (_May 2016_);
* `./pop`: various Excel and and CSV files with population and affected numbers analsyis. The Excel files (especially `outcomes.xlsx`) contain valuable pivot tables of outcomes and affected population/deficit calculations.
* `./prices`: data (mostly sourced from the NSA) and analysis of price time series for forecasting price problem specs.

For instructions on how to use GitHub and Git with these spreadsheets, see `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

Please also see `lz_names_codes.md` for a discussion on the livelihood zones names and codes.

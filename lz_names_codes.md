Here is a bit of an explanation of the codes and the abbreviations:

> Why keep the **NA** prefix on all the abbreviations?

This harmonises the LZ code names with other countries in the region. **NA** is Namibia's [IS0-3166-1 alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) national code so it uniquely identifies the LZ across the whole world (and not just the region). A code like **EKSS** could easily exist in another country. By making the _LZ part_ (the _3rd_, _4th_ and _5th_ characters) of the abbreviation only three characters long makes it quick and easy to type, important when you're transcribing tables and long lists of livelihood zones and their parameters. Abbreviations and code should very rarely change whereas the LZ name can change all the time or be written differently. Examples abound such as **Omusati-Omaheke-Otjozundjupa cattle ranching** versus **Omusati, Omaheke & Otjozundjupa Cattle Ranching** (_note the differences!_). With a good coding system, these typographical differences in name do not matter, especially to computers, because they will only link things up on the LZ codes, not the LZ names.

> Is the **56** in the number code they same idea as the **NA**?

Yes. Before South Sudan's independence Namibia had the _56th-most northerly point_ from the north of the continent (it is now _57th_). However, this isn't really such a good choice of code, as it only works in Africa an gets messed up if new countries come into being that are north of Namibia. Better to use the ISO numeric code ([ISO 3166-1 numeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric))

> Do the other numbers mean something?

Yes! The third digit represents the _type_ of livelihood: livestock-based (`1`), crop-based (`3`), a mixture of the two (`2`), hunter-gatherers (`5`), plantations (e.g. sugar, forests) (`6`), fishing (`7`), urban (`8`) or government (`9`). The forth and fifth digits determine the tenure system, with `00` to `49` being for traditional, open access-type tenure and `50` to `99` being for freehold or leasehold exclusive access-type tenure.

> Do other countries use this system?

Well, sort of. No one has to (even though it makes sense). SADC doesn't push it (yet).
